	<LI>The Text Tools dialog box remains open when you click <b>Apply</b>, so you can make other modifications to the selected cells. Or, you can select another range of cells 
    to work with.<BR></LI>

	<LI>After you click <b>Apply</b>, you can choose <b>Undo</b>&nbsp; (or 
    press Ctrl+Z) to reverse the effects. Note that only one level of undo is 
    available.<BR></LI>

	<LI>Text Tools works only with non-empty cells. Therefore, you can select entire rows or columns. Note, however, that you cannot use Text Tools to add text to empty cells.<BR></LI>

	<LI>If <B>Skip non-text cells</B> is checked, the utility works only on cells in the selection that contain text 
    (as opposed to values). If left unchecked, the utility works with cells that contain either text or values. 
    Blank cells and cells that contain formulas are always skipped.<BR></LI>

	<LI>When removing spaces from text, the <b>All excess spaces</b> option converts multiple spaces to a single space, and removes all spaces from the beginning and end of the text.<BR></LI>

	<LI>The Text Tools utility is appropriate only for text in worksheet cells. For example, you cannot use the Text Tools utility to make a chart label upper case.<BR></LI>

	<LI>The Text Tools utility works only with text entered directly into cells, 
    and formulas are ignored. For example, the Text Tools utility will have no effect on a cell that has a formula such as =UPPER(A1), even though that formula displays text in its cell.<BR></LI>
